NAME
    App::git::hub - The git-hub command on CPAN.

SYNOPSIS
        > cpanm App::git::hub
        > git hub

DESCRIPTION
    The "git-hub" command allows you to do most of your GitHub interaction
    from the terminal.

    The project is here: <https://github.com/ingydotnet/git-hub#readme>

    The command is written in Bash, but some Perl people wanted to be able
    to install it from CPAN. This module is an attempt to do that.

EXPERIMENTAL!!!
    I have no idea how well this will work out, or whether I want to support
    this in the future.
